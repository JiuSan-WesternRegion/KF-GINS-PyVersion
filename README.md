# KF-GINS-PyVersion
A python version of the KF-GINS

## About this Project
Due to the requirement that I will carry out the Deep Learning-based navigation method, I need a Python version INS algorithm to integrate the DL-based model which is written with PyTroch Lib， and conduct the new method based on this version.
